            Hi, my name is Jacob Marshall. I am a researcher, a software engineer, and an undergraduate student at the <a href = "https://ku.edu">University of Kansas</a>. <br>
            I am currently mentored and employed by <a href ="https://ittc.ku.edu/~drew/">Dr. Drew Davidson</a> as part of the <a href="http://ittc.ku.edu/padlock/">Padlock Research Laboratory</a> at KU and am conducting research on <a href="research.html">drone sensor input-spoofing attacks</a>. 
            When I’m not studying or doing research, I have a variety of other <a href = "projects.html">personal projects</a> that keep me busy.<br><br>
            Above all, I like working on hard problems. The ones that haven’t been solved before, and for good reason. I consider my interests within the realm of computer science to be pretty broad. I enjoy learning about the applications of software to financial markets. I’m curious about how we can continue to ensure that systems are made secure from attacks by ever-adapting adversaries. I want to find out how humans can better interact harmoniously with robotic systems. <br><br>
            I am currently in the late stages of the application process for several PhD programs, but have also been on the lookout for top-of-the-line full-time positions in industry. I hope to have my future sorted out by the end of April.<br><br>
            When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I immensely enjoy spending time outdoors, doing anything from soccer, to mountain biking, to hiking. I also enjoy playing board games and card games, and hope to become a better cook someday. <br><br>
            If you'd like to learn more about me, check out my blog, projects, or research pages!
