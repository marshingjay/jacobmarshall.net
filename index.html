        <h3>About me</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>I am an undergraduate student at the <a href = "https://ku.edu">University of Kansas</a> studying Computer Science. 
            I am currently mentored by <a href ="https://ittc.ku.edu/~drew/">Dr. Drew Davidson</a> as part of the <a href="http://ittc.ku.edu/padlock/">Padlock Research Laboratory</a> and am conducting research on drone sensor input spoofing attacks. 
            I will be graduating from the University of Kansas in May 2020 and will commence my postgraduate studies thereafter at __TBA__. 
            My current interests include algorithms and security, and I hope to continue to learn new things each and every day.
            In my free time I enjoy playing comptetive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering">Magic: The Gathering</a>, drinking cider, and spending time outdoors. 
        </p>

        <h3>Research</h3>
        <h5>Sensor Input Spoofing in UAV Control Software</h5>
        <p>Current UAV control software (ArduPilot) is vulnerable to many different attacks in which an adversery is able to subtly influence the environment. 
            Using SITL while running ArduPilot's source code, we were able to verify several of these vulnerabilities and developed attack models to demonstrate that a malicious party could disrupt, crash, or even gain some amount of control of a drone with the proper knowledge of ArduPilot and control of certain environmental factors. 
            This flaw boils down to a lack of sensor fusion between sensors of different types. 
            That is, sensors on the drone don't cross-validate input between orthagonal sensors if that input is acceptable, and as a result are vulnerable to environment-based attacks against certain sensors. 
            We suggest new threat models be introduced that account for adverseries with this type of control and suggest software be developed that mitigate these types of attacks.
