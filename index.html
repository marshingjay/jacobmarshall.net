        <h3 style="font-style: italic;">About Me</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Hi, my name is Jacob Marshall. I am a researcher, a software engineer, and an undergraduate student at the <a href = "https://ku.edu">University of Kansas</a>. 
            I am currently mentored and employed by <a href ="https://ittc.ku.edu/~drew/">Dr. Drew Davidson</a> as part of the <a href="http://ittc.ku.edu/padlock/">Padlock Research Laboratory</a> and am conducting research on <a href="research.html">drone sensor input-spoofing attacks</a>. 
            I will be graduating from the University of Kansas in May 2020 and am currently exploring many different oppurtunities for what to do afterwards. I'm currently in the late stages of the application process for several different PhD programs, but 
            am also open to full-time industry work if an ideal oppurtunity would present itself. As far as my interests go, I don't like to box myself in to just one area of computer science, as I find most of the problems within computer science interesting. 
            However, if I had to pick my favorite areas those would currently be Security, Fintech, and Robotics. My long-term goals aren't set in stone yet, but I find I'm happiest when working on projects that I find meaningful, whether that be because I personally find them interesting or because of their ability to positively impact the lives of others.
            I like to work on hard problems. I like to solve problems that haven't been solved before.
            <br><br>
            If you'd like to learn more about my current/past projects as well as my research, you can do so by clicking on the links in the navbar above.

        <p id="twitch">I've recently begun streaming some of the development of my personal software projects on Twitch. It might not be the most exciting thing in the world, but I plan to do it more so I've created a seperate channel just for this kind of content.</p>
