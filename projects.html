                After spending much of the past several months learning more and more about quantitative trading, I decided it was finally time to get in on the action myself. Vivaldi is being built with Python and Go in collaboration with another KU student, and is a fully-fledged 
                algorithmic trading platform for cryptocurrencies, tailored for personal use. The goal of Vivaldi is to provide a robust and ruthless backtesting infrastructure that allows the user to fully evaluate the effectiveness of strategies over large historical datasets. We allow for complex ML models, and are working on techniques such as genetic parameter optimization to maximize trading performance. Eventually, the strategies developed in the backtesting environment will be able to be seamelessly integrated into an equally robust live-trading environment alongside an automated portfolio manager.<br><br>

                I've always loved the card game <i><a href=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion>Dominion</a></i>.
                It offers a new game-play experience each and every game and rewards good sequencing and planning ahead. One day I decided that I would attempt to code up the game myself, so I could then try to 
                program bots to play it. After that, I decided that I wanted to make it a public-facing platform for others to use to develop their own AI-powered Dominion bots. This project allows 
                users to easily implement their own AI bots in a highly-configurable and modular setting, and test them via quickly simulating millions of games. I even implemented a few rudimentary bots
                myself which are included in the codebase. I consider the project to be in a somewhat-completed, alpha-ish state but I plan on continuing to refine the platform in the future. Axiom is written in Python,
                 with a focus on ease-of-use and code readability. <br><br>

                Paperboy is a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/papertrade.asp#:~:text=A%20paper%20trade%20is%20a,risking%20money%20in%20live%20markets.">paper trading</a> discord bot that manages a personal portfolio for each discord user that accesses it, allowing for users to simulate trading 24/7 with no real-life stakes. Paperboy uses the Alpaca Trading API to provide minute-to-minute access to equity prices on a variety of exchanges, and allows users to access and manage their portfolio on any server that the bot is invited to. Other notable features include 7 day portfolio charts (still kinda WIP) and informative account summaries.
                 Paperboy is built with Python, the Python Discord API, the Alpaca Trading API, the IEX Trading API, and MongoDB.

                100Words is a mad-lib style web application that I developed alongside Gage Phillips for our Databases class, where users create a prompt for a story (100 words long exactly) that will be completed by 
                users all over the globe, each user submitting a single word. This application is no longer hosted because we are poor undergraduate students,
                but the repo is still available!

                Flat Earth Space Program (FESP) is a 2D space simulator created by Zachary Atkins, Gage Phillips, Thomas Gartman, and myself for our Software Engineering class.
                Players have a large sandbox, planets, and Newtonian physics at their disposal as they attempt to pilot a small rocket. 
                Features include trajectory prediction, a custom rocket-builder system, simulated liquid/solid rockets, and much more!
                FESP was built with Python, and the pymunk (physics) and pygame libraries were heavily utilized.
