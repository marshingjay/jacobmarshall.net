                I've always loved the card game <i><a href=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion>Dominion</a></i>.
                It offers a new game-play experience each and every game and rewards good sequencing and planning ahead. One day I decided that I would attempt to code up the game myself, so I could then try to 
                program bots to play it. After that, I decided that I wanted to make it a public-facing platform for others to use to develop their own AI-powered Dominion bots. This project allows 
                users to easily implement their own AI bots in a highly-configurable and modular setting, and test them via quickly simulating millions of games. I even implemented a few rudimentary bots
                myself which are included in the codebase. I consider the project to be in a somewhat-completed, alpha-ish state but I plan on continuing to refine the platform in the future. Axiom is written in Python,
                 with a focus on ease-of-use and code readability. <br><br>

                Paperboy is a discord bot that manages a shared paper-trading portfolio for each discord server it's added to, allowing for users to simulate trading 24/7 with no real-life stakes while cooperating to grow their shared account with other members of their server.
                 Paperboy is built with Python, the Python Discord API, the Alpaca Trading API, and MongoDB.

                I've recently become super interested in the application of software to financial markets, specifically to the stock market.
                I decided to implement this tool to allow for users to be alerted when a stock price is up massively, and when it begins to go down again, allowing for a high amount of configuration on the user's part.
                I'm very, very interested in algorithm trading, and I hope this project serves as a stepping stone to that while allowing me to gain familiarity with stock market APIs and working with prices and other data in an automated setting.
                I eventually hope this into a web-app so that others may use it without running a script. Hype.watch is currently being developed using Python, and utilizes the Alpaca API to access minute-to-minute stock-market data.

                100Words is a mad-lib style web application that I developed alongside Gage Phillips for our Databases class, where users create a prompt for a story (100 words long exactly) that will be completed by 
                users all over the globe, each user submitting a single word. This application is no longer hosted because we are poor undergraduate students,
                but the repo is still available!

                Flat Earth Space Program (FESP) is a 2D space simulator created by Zachary Atkins, Gage Phillips, Thomas Gartman, and myself for our Software Engineering class.
                Players have a large sandbox, planets, and Newtonian physics at their disposal as they attempt to pilot a small rocket. 
                Features include trajectory prediction, a custom rocket-builder system, simulated liquid/solid rockets, and much more!
                FESP was built with Python, and the pymunk (physics) and pygame libraries were heavily utilized.
